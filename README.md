# ButterCMS Blog Theme

This repository contains a responsive blog theme based off the [ButterCMS blog](https://buttercms.com/blog/). This theme uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) but it can easily be swapped out. The theme does not include a traditional header or footer since it is designed to be integrated into an existing website layout containing a header and footer.

[See the theme](https://buttercms.github.io/blog-template/)

### CSS

The theme's CSS files live in the `styles` directory. `styles.css` is generated from the [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) file `styles.scss`. To compile changes to the SASS file, install SASS and run the following command:

```shell
sass --watch styles/styles.scss:styles/styles.css
```
