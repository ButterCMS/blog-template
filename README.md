# ButterCMS Blog Template

This repository contains a responsive blog template based off the [ButterCMS blog](https://buttercms.com/blog/). It includes HTML and CSS for a blog index page and individual post page. The template uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) but it can easily be swapped out. The template does not include a traditional header or footer since it is designed to be integrated into an existing website theme.

### CSS

The theme's CSS files live in the `styles` directory. `styles.css` is generated from the [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) file `styles.scss`. To compile changes to the SASS file, install SASS and run the following command:

```shell
sass --watch styles/styles.scss:styles/styles.css
```
